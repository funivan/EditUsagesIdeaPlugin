# Edit Usages

## Why?
Find usages is one of the most powerful features in PhpStorm. You can export all usages to the file, edit it and apply changes to all files with the help of this plugin.
How I do it: find usages (for example I find some method call), `create custom patch`, edit this patch (with multiple cursors, multiple selections, etc), then I just apply these changes with action `apply custom patch`.
It is very fast and simple way to edit your code.


## How to use?
1. Run `find usages`.
2. Focus on the usages panel.
3. Invoke `Create patch from usages` action or invoke context menu on usages and select `Create custom patch`.
4. Edit the patch.
5. Invoke `Apply custom patch` action.
6. Check changes.

## Demo

For better performance set hotkeys for two actions: `Create custom patch` and `Apply custom patch`.
